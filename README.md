# GolangCLI
Implementing a simple CLI in Golang

This CLI is very simple. To start make sure you have at least Golang Version 1.17.1 installed. Navigate to the directory you have this file in and us the command go run goCLI.go to start CLI. Keep in mind this CLI only works in windows but can be easily modfied for linux if necessary. 

## Two commands
The first command is simply the "exit" command where if you type "exit" into the CLI it will terminate the program. 
The second command is "goping <IP of cloud machine>" which will ping the IP address of that machine 3 times and return a summary of the communication.
